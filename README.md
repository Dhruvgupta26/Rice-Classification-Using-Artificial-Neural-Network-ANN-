# Rice-Classification-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-
This project presents a rice classification system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on morphological features such as area, perimeter, and shape parameters. Exploratory Data Analysis and preprocessing were performed before training the model, which achieved about 98.5% accuracy, showing effective classification performance.
